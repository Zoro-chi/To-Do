# My To-Do App
A simple To-do app, that stores PROJECTS and assigns tasks to each project. App persists through localstorage instead of a database. Tasks can be filtered.

## How To Use: 
            *) Fairly straight forward and simple app
            *) Projects are containers for similar tasks or to-do's and you create them first!
            *) After creating a Project, click on the project to and a new heading stating the tasks for the project.
            *) You can create tasks by clicking on the project you want and then clicking on the "+" symbol next to it.
            *) All fields of the task form must be completed to submit!
            *) ENJOY :)

## Optimizations
I feel the UI class of the code base can be refactored further if I had more time (I rushed the ending). After completion i noticed aspects of my UI class code that should be in my Project or Tasks Class. It was also my first time working with date objects and also date-fns, the due Date on the "Today" and "This week" filters could be made consitent and not display different formats. 

## Lessons Learned:

This is was a good way for me to learn about and practice OOP. I could have done a lot better in seperation of concerns of each class object, but also with the implementation of abstraction and encapsulation in this project shows I did learn somethings.
